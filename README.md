This is the repository for the AI research I have been working on. Right now the only project I have is comparing the training of object detectors on fully labled data and single class data


create_coco_tf_record.py is the script i used to build the custom TFrecord files

data.xlsx contains the coco metric data recorded from evaluating various network

Graps.zip contains images of the weights and biases from the network that seemed unsual or otherwise notable to me

modelConfigs contains the config files for the networks that I trained
